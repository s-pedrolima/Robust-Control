# Robust Control 

Main repository to reunite all robust control functions and tests in simulated environments for study porpuses

## Main Functions 

- Standard LQR - for nominal systems 
- Robust LQR - for system with unceartanties
- Robust RLQR - reduced form of Robust LQR
- Guaranteed Cost - for systems with unceartanties

## Simulated Environments 

- Cart with inverted pendulum
- Active suspension
